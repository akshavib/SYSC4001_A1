# Interrupt Handling Simulation
Welcome! This is Akshavi and Liam's SYSC4001_A1 submission. 

This project simulates interrupt handling in a simplified CPU environment. It models system calls, I/O completions, context switching, and interrupt service routines (ISRs) while analyzing performance under varying conditions like ISR duration, context save time, vector table size, and CPU speed.
